# webpack-riotjs

My default webpack setup for creating riotjs projects.

Its used with benefit together with this <a href="https://github.com/opture/generator-riot-element">yeoman generator</a> for tags.

There are some conventions to this setup.
tags are stored under app/tags/

To me this is a clear way of doing things. I get to create element totally independently of each other, and I can have a full view 
of how my tags are created their functions and their css.
